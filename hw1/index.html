    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>With nearly 70 full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest
        department in the College of Engineering and Computing, one of the largest departments
        on campus, and the largest and fastest growing CS department in the Commonwealth of Virginia. </p>

    <p>Today, not only is computing pervasive in society, but computational methods are used in almost
        every field of scholarly endeavor ranging from the arts and humanities to the hard sciences and
        engineering, as well as every sector of industry. Given the importance of computing in today's world,
        we strongly support the goal of "Computing for All", providing a diverse array of programs and courses
        in computing to students from all backgrounds and at all levels.</p>

    <h3>Where am I from?</h3>
    <p>I'm originally from a small country called New Zealand where we all have pet sheep and watch <a
            href="http://www.allblacks.com/" target="_blank">Rugby</a> every day of the week. I grew up in a small town
        but moved over to the UK a few years ago and I'm now living in the countryside in Ireland.</p>

    <h3>What is my Dream Job?</h3>
    <p>Part of the reason I'm learning to code is because I want to be able to put my own ideas into practice. My dream
        'job' would be to build my own product and be responsbible for the entire experience from design through to
        implementation. </p>

    <h3>What music have you been listening to?</h3>
    <p>I only just recently discovered an awesome website called <a href="http://hypem.com" target="_blank">Hype
        Machine</a> which watches popular music blogs and discovers new artists and lets you stream all the music
        completely free. I've been really implressed with their breadth and can just hit play and forget about it.</p>
