    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>With nearly 70 full-time faculty members, the CS Department at Mason is the largest
        department in the College of Engineering and Computing, one of the largest departments
        on campus, and the largest and fastest growing CS department in the Commonwealth of Virginia. </p>

    <p>Today, not only is computing pervasive in society, but computational methods are used in almost
        every field of scholarly endeavor ranging from the arts and humanities to the hard sciences and
        engineering, as well as every sector of industry. Given the importance of computing in today's world,
        we strongly support the goal of "Computing for All", providing a diverse array of programs and courses
        in computing to students from all backgrounds and at all levels.</p>

    <h2>Program Survey</h2>
    <p>As a part of improving the Computer Science Department, we collect surveys from students and faculty.</p>
